# SpringBoot
My first SpringBoot app.

Servlet is based on SpringBoot, Maven, JPA, JSP.

Aplication's role is to enable sign in or sign up,
depending on whether that user entity existance in the DB.
If he is not - register page will be shown and regisration process must take place.
After sign in/sign up user will see all his previous posts if he had any in DB.
In any time he can ad new post and it will be stored in DB and shown on the user page.
